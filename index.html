            <h1> The Safest Private Airplane Ever Built</h1>

        <p>The Cessna 172 is one of the safest, best built small airplanes ever. Thousands of 172's built<br> 
        in the 1960's are still operating today, particularly as trainers in flight schools. When first <br>
        introduced they were relatively cheap and extremely safe. In fact, to make the plane <br>
        stall requires considerable effort. It really "wants" to fly even when the pilot makes a mistake. </p>

        <p>The Cessna 172 is easy to fly. While all flying takes months of studying and practice to <br>
        learn and get your license, the 172 is one of the easiest and safest. Landing an airplane <br>
        is one the most difficult tasks to master. However, the 172 makes it look easy. Click on the <br>
        link below to view a brief video showing a 172 making a nearly perfect landing.

        <p>It is relatively expensive to learn how to fly. The cost ranges from about $10,000 to $15,000.<br>
        It depends on how long it takes the student to learn to fly. Federal regulations require that you<br>
        have at least 40 hours of flight training and 10 hours of ground school to get your pilot's license.<br>
        The majority of that cost is airplane rental at $150 - $200 per hour. The Cessna 172 is one of the <br>
        cheapest planes to rent so using one will keep the cost of learning to fly down to a minimum.</p>
